# stack-templates
This repository has templates set up for stack that set up a directory structure as needed for various kinds of projects. 

- comp3351.hsfiles: sets up a very basic stack project using LTS-18.19, defaulting to system-wide install if possible, adding hspec to the project, and adding numerous compiler extensions for Haskell.
